Hi! My name is Li Lin (林丽). I’m currently an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering in Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/). 
I am also affiliated with the [DiTing (Data FusIon and IoT IntelliGence) Lab](http://123.57.255.174:8080/#/home).


Education
======
* Ph.D. in School of Software, Tsinghua University, 2022
* B.S. in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2016


Research Outline
======
My research interests lie in the fields of sequential modeling, multimodal learning, and reasoning on LLMs.
In particular, I am interested in multimodel LLMs and focusing on:
* Reasoning and Efficient Prompting on LLMs
* Multimodal Prediction and Decision-making
* Sequential Forecasting and Generation
